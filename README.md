# LUPermitToolbox

The LU Permit Toolbox is an Python toolbox for use with ESRI ArcGIS Pro software. The **Generate Land Use Permit Maps** tool 
automates the production of Land Use permit maps for Snohomish County PDS.

### Instructions

The LU Permit Toolbox is intended to be used with a specific ArcGIS Pro project file, which is located in
the same directory as the Python Toolbox .pyt file:

* PermitMaps.aprx

If the **Generate Land Use Permit Maps** tool within the toolbox is opened in another Pro project file, 
it will *not* work.
